        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onion in small cubes</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a hot pot with a bit of olive oil</li>
            <li>Poach the onion at low heat until translucid</li>
            <li>Clean and chop the selected mushroom</li>
            <li>Add the boletus to the pot with salt and pepper to liking</li>
            <li>Saute for a couple of minutes at medium-high heat until it has reduced to about half its volume</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir vigorously so it doesn't burn</li>
            <li>Add the wine and stir until the alcohol has evaporated</li>
            <li>While doing so, preheat the broth at a constant temperature without boiling</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to medium-low and start by adding the broth in small quantities</li>
            <li>Each time the rice looks like it's getting dry, add more broth. Repeat for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>By that time, test the cooking of the rice. If it's not fully cooked add more broth and cook until your liking</li>
            <li>Add the grated parmesan and the cream. Stir to fully incorporate the ingredients</li>
            <li>Let the risotto rest in the pot, covered, so it finishes cooking</li>
            <li>When serving, we recommend topping the plate with a few parmesan flakes</li>
        </ol>
